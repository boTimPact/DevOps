## Assignment 4 - Containerization

### Approach

1. To start of I tried out the Visual Studio 2022 method to add dockersupport, which didn't work out to great, because I could't get the container to run outside of Visual Studio's debug feature. After uploading the image via Visual Studios publish feature to DockerHub and pulling the image I was able to start and test out my first container.

2. Still I wanted to learn the process myself and found some inspiration [here][1]. I was able to create my Dockerfile by modifying the given template and adding the required functionality. As I have gained some useful experience with Docker commands (step 1), the build process was relatively straightforward. Starting a container from the created image also proved to be uncomplicated.

3. I uploaded my new Image to DockerHub and deleted the old version.

### Outcome

After great initial difficulties, I managed to figure out the process and am now able to create and run Dockerimages
