## Assignment 2 - Webservice

### Process

I choose C# and the Asp.Net Core framework to create my Webservice because I have gathered some experience over the semester break.

### Approach

1. Creation of a Asp.Net Mvc App
1. Added required Actions (Get/Post)
1. Updated Index page (buttons & textarea with simple styling using bootstrap)
1. Created Ajax functions called by buttons
1. Created a simple Dataservice
1. Added Dependency Injection for the Dataservice
1. Use Dataservice in Controller Actions
1. Updated Api Json response formatting to the specified format

### Outcome

The Webservice works how it's suppose to. It is even capable to persist data through multiple requests. Using the Asp.Net framework has made my work very easy, as it already comes with a decent template.
