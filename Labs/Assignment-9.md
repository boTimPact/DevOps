## Assignment 9 - Terraform

### Approach

1. I looked through the `terraform` provider-list and noticed a Docker provider. I thought it would be nice to see how it would compare to `docker-compose`
2. I then checked out the documentation on `images`, `containers` and `advanced networks`.
3. As the documentation is super clear the configuration was easily done. 
4. With some tweaking and tinkering stuff like networking and environment variables I was able to automaticly create docker containers and connect to the click app

### Outcome

Compared to the Kubernetes lab, this was actually quite easy and quick to set up.
